    'Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory,algebra,geometry, and analysis, respectively. There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline.',

    'The Dutch Language Union was established by a treaty between the Netherlands and Belgium, as a platform for cooperation on issues concerning the Dutch language. Suriname is an associate member.

    'Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools. The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.',

    'Writing is a neuropsychological activity and cognitive process whose the purpose is creating media, i.e. mainly texts. It structures and translates volatile human thoughts into persistent human communication, through the use of languages and their related writing systems. Writing uses epigraphic inscriptions for producing documents, which record texts in natural/physical media (e.g. stones or papers) with hands and pens/inks or printing presses and types/inks, or in digital media with typesetting systems and word processors.[1][2] Writing systems do not themselves constitute human languages (with the debatable exception of computer languages); they are a means of rendering language into a form that can be reconstructed by other humans separated by time and/or space.[3][4] While not all languages use a writing system, those that do can complement and extend capacities of spoken language by creating durable forms of language that can be transmitted across space (e.g. written correspondence) and stored over time (e.g. libraries or other public records).[5] It has also been observed that the activity of writing itself can have knowledge-transforming effects, since it allows humans to externalize their thinking in forms that are easier to reflect on, elaborate, reconsider, and revise.[6][7] A system of writing relies on many of the same semantic structures as the language it represents, such as lexicon and syntax, with the added dependency of a system of symbols representing that languages phonology and morphology. Nevertheless, written languages in the course of inscription may take on characteristics distinctive from any available in spoken language.[8] The result of the activity of writing is called a text, and the interpreter or activator of a text is called a reader',
