## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [Tailwind CSS](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [markdown-it](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [Firebase](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [Netlify](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [Material UI](https://nextjs.org/) 

To get started with the project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

You will also need to set up a Firebase project and configure the firebase credentials in the .env file.

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on http://localhost:3000

The project is deployed on Netlify, so you can visit the live version at https://stalwart-lolly-b9d943.netlify.app/login

If you have any questions or run into any issues, please don't hesitate to open an issue in the GitHub repository.
